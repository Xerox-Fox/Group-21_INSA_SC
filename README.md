# SIEM Lite: Affordable & Lightweight Security Information and Event Management System

## 1. Executive Summary

Cybersecurity threats are increasing in both frequency and
sophistication, yet Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs), startups,
NGOs, and individual developers often lack access to affordable and
easy-to-use security monitoring tools. Enterprise SIEM solutions such as
Splunk, IBM QRadar, and ArcSight are expensive, complex, and require
skilled engineers to operate.\
\
SIEM Lite aims to close this gap by delivering a lightweight,
cost-effective, and user-friendly SIEM platform that provides real-time
log monitoring, threat detection, and alerting without the overhead of
enterprise tools.\
\
Our solution will enable smaller organizations to monitor their systems,
detect suspicious activity early, and respond to incidents quickly ---
improving their security posture at a fraction of the cost.

## 2. Problem Statement

\- Rising Cyber Threats: SMBs and small IT teams face constant risks
like brute-force attacks, phishing, SQL injections, ransomware, and
insider threats.\
- High Costs: Commercial SIEM solutions can cost thousands of dollars
per month, pricing out smaller organizations.\
- Complexity: Open-source SIEMs require extensive configuration,
maintenance, and technical expertise.\
- Lack of Accessibility: There is a shortage of simple, plug-and-play
monitoring tools for non-enterprise environments.

## 3. Proposed Solution: SIEM Lite

SIEM Lite will be a modular, cloud-ready, and easy-to-install SIEM
system with core features tailored for smaller teams:

Key Features (MVP):\
1. Log Collection -- Collect logs from servers, endpoints, firewalls,
web applications; support syslog, REST API, and file upload ingestion.\
2. Parsing & Normalization -- Convert raw logs into a structured format
for easy analysis.\
3. Event Correlation -- Rule-based detection for brute-force login
attempts, unauthorized file access, SQL injection patterns, XSS
attempts.\
4. Real-time Alerting -- Email, Slack, Telegram, or Webhook
notifications.\
5. Dashboard & Visualization -- Web-based UI to view events, alerts, and
trends.\
6. Reporting -- Daily/weekly PDF or CSV summaries.\
7. Security -- Encrypted log transfer & role-based access.

## 4. Target Audience

\- Small to Medium Businesses (SMBs)\
- Non-profits & NGOs\
- Educational Institutions\
- Freelance Developers & IT Consultants\
- Startups in Developing Markets

## 5. Competitive Advantage

\- Affordability: Fraction of enterprise SIEM cost\
- Simplicity: Minimal setup, intuitive UI\
- Lightweight: Low resource requirements\
- Flexible Deployment: Cloud-hosted SaaS or on-premises\
- Customizable: Add new detection rules easily

## 6. Technology Stack

\- Backend: Python (FastAPI) or Node.js (Express)\
- Frontend: React.js + TailwindCSS\
- Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL\
- Log Processing: Custom parser + optional ELK integration\
- Hosting: Docker-based, deployable to AWS / Azure / DigitalOcean\
- Security: TLS encryption, JWT authentication

## 7. Expected Outcomes

\- Enable SMBs and smaller organizations to detect cyber threats early\
- Provide a cost-effective alternative to enterprise SIEM tools\
- Improve global cybersecurity posture in under-served markets\
- Position SIEM Lite as a recognized niche leader for lightweight
security monitoring

## 8. Conclusion

SIEM Lite bridges the gap between costly, complex enterprise SIEMs and
the real-world needs of smaller organizations. By focusing on
simplicity, affordability, and core security features, this project can
capture an untapped market and make cybersecurity accessible to more
people.\
\
We seek \[investment/partnership/collaboration\] to bring SIEM Lite from
concept to reality, securing the digital environments of thousands of
users worldwide.
